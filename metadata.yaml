description: 'Odysseus recounts his struggles to sail home to Ithaca in one of the
  greatest pieces of storytelling in Western literature. In this new verse adaptation,
  originally commissioned for BBC Radio, Simon Armitage has recast Homer''s epic as
  a series of bristling dramatic dialogues: between gods and men; between no-nonsense
  Captain Odysseus and his unruly, lotus-eating, homesick companions; and between
  subtle Odysseus (wiliest hero of antiquity) and a range of shape-shifting adversaries--Calypso,
  Circe, the Sirens, the Cyclops--as he and his men are "pinballed between islands"
  of adversity. One of the most individual voices of his generation, Armitage revitalizes
  our sense of the Odyssey as oral poetry, as indeed one of the greatest of tall tales.
  Dramatization on 3 CDs.'
